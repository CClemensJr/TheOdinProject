# Add your new methods onto the existing Enumerable module. Ruby makes this easy for you
# because any class or module can be added to without trouble ... just do something like:
    #module Enumerable
    #  def my_each
    #    # your code here
    #  end
    #end

module Enumerable
  def my_each
    #my code here
  end
end
